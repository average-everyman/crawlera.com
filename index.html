    <h3>What is Crawlera?</h3>

    <p>Crawlera is a smart downloader designed specifically for
    web crawling and scraping. It allows you to crawl quickly and reliably,
    managing thousands of proxies internally, so you donâ€™t have to.</p>

    <p>
      Crawlera routes requests through a pool of IPs, throttling access by introducing
      delays and discarding IPs from the pool
    when they get banned from certain domains, or have other problems.</p>

    <p>Accounts provide a standard HTTP proxy API, so you can configure it in
    your crawler of choice and start crawling.</p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>Crawlera distributes requests among many internal nodes, using a
    proprietary algorithm to minimize the risks of getting banned, by throttling
    requests sent to sites from each internal node. If, for whatever reason, any
    node gets banned, Crawlera will blacklist it and avoid using it for future
    requests to that domain.
    </p>
    <p>Banned requests typically return a non-200 response (like 403 or 503), or
    redirect to a captcha page. These responses are detected by Crawlera and the
    requests are automatically retried from another (clean) node.</p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Instant access to thousands of IPs in our shared pool.</li>
      <li>IPs from 50+ countries available on request.</li>
      <li>A ban detection database with over 130 ban types, status codes or captchas.</li>
      <li>Automatic retrying and throttling to crawl smoothly and prevent bans.</li>
      <li>HTTP and HTTPS proxy support (with CONNECT).
    </ul>

    <p>Only successful downloads are charged.</p>
